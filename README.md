- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @stringzzz 
- Fictional (For Now) Software Company: Ghostwarez Co.
- My main interests involving coding revolve around artificial intelligence, mathematics, and security. 
I would someday like to combine A.I. with cryptology to further cryptanalysis and cryptographic algorithms.

- My history with cryptology started with the basic cryptogram puzzles you could find in newspapers and word puzzle books.
 After learning how to solve those, I began devising ciphers that would be resistant to those same kinds of techniques.
 Eventually, I got into coding and almost immediately began applying those concepts to digital ciphers.
 I also got into real basic chat bots as well, going from JavaScript to Perl.
 I can definitely look back on my early programs, even some only from a few years back, and feel embarassed over their quality.
 That being said, I recognize that we all have to start somewhere, and I've made a lot of progress since then.

- I've had a slow and rocky start with my formal schooling, but I finally got on the right track and now I am pursuing
 a degree in Computer Science.

-The languages I've worked most with are:
x86 Assembly
C
C++
Python
HTML/CSS/JavaScript
Some PHP

- My ultimate goal with my degree is to combine all of my passions into one area of research and development, mostly based on cryptology.
